# multi_class_classification_using_CNN
Multiclass classification of food items using Convolutional Neural Network

The following steps were employed in this project:
- Becoming one with the data (visualization).
- Preprocessing the data (preparing it for a model).
- Creating a model (starting with a baseline).
- Fitting the model.
- Evaluating the model.
- Adjusting different parameters and improving model (trying to beat the baseline).
- Repeating until satisfied,
